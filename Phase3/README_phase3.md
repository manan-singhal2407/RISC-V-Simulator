Contribution:
We shared the work among ourselves equally and helped each other. and we did coding collectively on Google-meet.
LOGIC THINKING by ALL

How to run the program:
1.First of all, unzip all the files.
2.To run phase3 code use the command $python3 Phase3.py "Your_mc_file.mc" 
#Example $python3 Phase3.py testcase1.mc


Working conditions:
1.Non-pipelining is working fine
2.In pipelining,there were problems with flushing and branch-prediction in Phase2. So, it may not work wherever the flushing is needed otherwise both data cache and instruction cache will work fine.
3.So, for pipelining test cases without control instructions can run properly.
