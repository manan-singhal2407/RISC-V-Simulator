1) First of all, unzip all the files.
2) To run use command $python3 Phase1.py "Your_mc_file.mc"      #Example $python3 Phase1.py Fact.mc

NOTE: 0xFFFFFFFF is the termination instruction, after that no further operations.



OUTPUT FORMAT:
1) At every instruction it will show fetched machine code and it's address.
2) Then it will show the operation needed to be performed and it's sources.
3) Then it will show the ALU content.
4) Then it will show whether the memory is accessed or not, if yes then show the address of memory.
5) Then it will show whether writeback is to be performed or not, if yes then it shows Destination register and value to be writebacked.
6) Then it will show the clock cycle at the particular instruction.
